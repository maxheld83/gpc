- The class should be spread over more days
- the quizzes cover too much material
- the class should be more about germany
- the teaching style is positive
- it's not clear how much people can really learn in a sustained way at this speed in such a short period of time
- the name of the class should be changed
- the quiz still does include some not so conceptual but rather "reading-checking" items
- the class might be too challening
- the individual days were too long
- the prep session should stress the amount of reading to be done
- the class and supporting material was well-structured
- "magic charts" are appreciated
- non-SHSS majors might be at a disadvantage
