## Milgram Lessons

presentations starts at 20:06
goes way overtime.

Zimbardo presentation
starts 20:49

good details, but not so much with big picture. maybe pictures?
great cartoon at the end.

people should cite more page numbers (or maybe not?)

notice: how did they get the police battalaion numbers?

## Milgram lessions
1. pre-arranged contractual argeement (think oath of office on hitler, voting)
2. meaningful roles (police officers, racial "hygiene", props, riding crop, boots)
3. set up rules before the fact
4. altering the semantics ("rid off the jews -- entjudung")
5. diffusion of responsibility (someone else will take my place)
6. little steps (hilbers step in the process)


## SPE Lessons

1. It's the situation stupid
2. Situational factors are *more* powerful in novel situations (no NS document on "how" to torture, to humiliate, young people uneducated)
3. Ambiguity, *no* instructions, unclear role definitions
4. Role playing works (props Bergen-Belsen), Dissonance theory we need to make sense of what we do
5. total situations seduce people to do evil (foucault: prisons, kinderkarten, hospital: every aspect of your life is covered by the institution)
6. Dr. Jekyll can be transformed into mr hyde

Mention the Bergen-Belsen strategy with the bread

Ideas to mitigate the power of the situation
- *Test* people in total situations
- *Teach* people about the SPE
- Allow and encourage dissent within groups and towards authority
- Give clear instructions, manuals, codes
- Take people *out* of total situations periodically
