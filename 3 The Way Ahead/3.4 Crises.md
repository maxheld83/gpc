## EMU

Why did EMU MS sovereign debt rates converge?
What is the commons?

It is harder to bet against one huge currency area, but, more importantly, there is some complicated backward reasoning going on with market participants:

1. If a MS has a trade/current account deficit and/or nears sovereign default it *cannot* revalue.
Other methods of lowering costs take longer, because wages are sticky.
2. So you have to exit the currency union to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive; that can only be done in a very haphazard way, including *all* deposits and cash *on Greek soil* as well as some denominated contracts.
3. Anticipating a devaluation and return to the Drachme, investors will already flea the country, causing more of 1 and 2.
4. To forestall the capital outflow, Greece will have to install capital controls, and maybe trade restrictions, too.
5. Because 5 would be the end of the union, investors anticipate that other MS would bail out Greece (which, in turn, is forbidden by the original SGP)

This leads to a Tragedy of the Commons


The Criteria for an optimal currency area are, according to Mundell
1. flexible wages and/or mobile labor
2. open markets for goods and services
3. business cycles correlate and shocks are symmetric
4. or, absent the above, fiscal complements
