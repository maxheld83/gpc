play the "Demokratie-Song" at the beginning, post on Google+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQKlel-CUIs

play the winner takes it all

again, we have two questions:
1. What *should* a democracy do (normatively)?
2. What *makes* a democracy (positively, definitionally)?

Make your definitions *MECE*: mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. 

Presentation Lijphart Majoritarianism (yulia)
starts at 10:17
1. not competent about tech
2. good lists, but a little circular with the explanation, not so much into the electoral system
3. solid work; Germany is a not a majoritarian democracy, it's consensus, yes -- also good to look at neighbors, could free speaking good
4. also good discussion question, even though it was maybe a little too much on the *factual* side; not so much opinion in there.
5. weimar comparison

## Debate notes

PM Zaina good summary; but just a little short it was PR (2)
Leader of the opposition gianina: good exchange with zaina about competition in PR vs in 2

Nils opposition whip limits to power (good, technical terms)


Presentation Lijphart Consensus (nikki)
starts at 10:27
1. all who are affected should participateie
2. nice to have a handout and begin with a quote
3. maybe a little too much writing; use graphic stuff for graphic things
4. 


Robert: really good comment again

## Empirically, How do Democracies Differ?

This is based on Lijphart's "Patterns of Democracy" (1999).
- Democracy is always about collectively binding decisions
- Which one is better at passing legislative proposals?
    - Westminster: more effective
        - not parties, but party executives decide
    - Consensus: the gentler, kinder form of democracy?
    - In Westminister, you vote your solutions, in Consensus, you vote your preferences
- Lijphart suggests two orthogonal dimensions; unitary/federal and executives/parties: we should not confuse them.


### Electoral Systems

- proportional representation
    - electorate, district: entire population
    - seats are awarded based on % of vote
- FTPT, Plurality, SMP
    - small districts (county of xyz)
    - seats are awarded to whoever wins the largest share of votes in any given district

## Lijphart 1999

### Introduction

Here's a little background on Lijphart 1999, to set you up for the reading and the discussion.

Lijphart's groundbreaking "Patterns of Democracy" is first and foremost a typology of different democracies. Lijphart (like many political scientists before him) empirically looked at the (36) real existing democracies in the world, and surveyed their characteristics on a couple of variables (for example: is there a written, rigid constitution?). He then looked at his data and wondered whether there were any patterns discernible from all these different combinations, and found that all these variables often mapped on only two dimensions. This means that many of these characteristics would often occur together with other characteristics, and could therefore be described as one phenomenon: for example, "powerful cabinets" and "one-party/bare-majority governments" often occurred together. Lijphart then suggested that these two (together with some other characteristics) define the "Westminster model" of democracy on its executives-parties dimension. 

Mapping these two dimensions on a 2-dimensional grid, scoring each country according to the characteristics (variables) on each of these dimensions yields the following map.

The top right hand corner is the Westminster or Majoritarian ideal type of democracy.

The bottom left hand corner is the Consensus ideal type of democracy.

In the assigned chapters, Lijphart discusses the main features of these two ideal types of democracies with some examples.

Ps.: Note that "ideal type" does not imply a value judgement.
