## National Anthems

FRG national anthem vs EU national anthem vs GDR national anthem: they all have the same key and meter.

"Deutschlandlied" / German National Anthem
- Music by Joseph Haydn 1732-1809 as the Emperor's Quartet
- Lyrics by August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben as "Das Lied der Deutschen". 
    (Only the third stanza of the song is now the official German National Anthem. 
    The first and second stanzas are not used because of their nationalist sentiment.)

#Peculiarities of the Basic Law

- Conscious of their responsibility before God and man -- a bow to Ausschwitz?

- Why is it called "The Basic Law" and why was Bonn the capital of the FRG?
- "Dem deutschen Volke" (for the german people) vs. "der deutschen Bevölkerung" (the people living in germany)

    - citizen ruights, human and universal rights.
- Compare all of the below, particularly "substantive guarantees" with two US founding documents
    - The Declaration of Independence 1776 http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/
    - The US Constitution http://constitutionus.com/
- "human dignity shall be inviolable" (Art 1, GG), "the duty of all state authority" (Art 1, GG, compare Art 20,3 GG)
    - universal rights
    - natural law
        - inviolable, inherent rights, independent of legislation
    - positive law
        - justice is whatever the state (people) say it is
    - substantive guarantees (≠ a merely procedural understanding of  democracy)
- basic rights as directly applicable law (Art 1,3 GG)
    - everyone can sue for constitutional violations
    - Judicial review vs. "Governing by justices"
        - examples from Germany:
            - Hartz 4 welfare legislation in 2010, 2011
            - Shooting down hijacked airliners (declared unconstitutional by the Federal Constitutional Court in 2005)
            - Right to marital intercourse (until 1997, there was no such thing as rape in marriage in Germany)
- if "you combat the free democratic basic order", you forfeit basic rights (Art 18, GG)
    - you can ban parties (they banned a couple of Nazi parties in the 1950s, the communist party, and continue to try to ban the national socialist NPD).
    - banning "radicals" from public service in the 1970s
    - ban (Nazi) symbols, books (Mein Kampf etc).
    - militant democracy
- right to resist (Art 20,4 GG) (again, militant democracy)
- eternity guarantee (Art 146, Art 79,3)
- democratic, social, federal state (Art 20, GG)
    - substantive guarantees on the structure and goals of the state
    - cf. fiscal federalism in the FRG
- republicanism (We the people are the sovereign, as opposed to monarchy)
    - cf. line of succession, head of state
- parliamentary democracy (as opposed to presidential)
    - cf. power of the chancellor vs. parliament
    - cf. line of succession, "the sovereign"
- liberal democracy
    - extensive catalogue of rights
    - pluralism
    - separation of powers
