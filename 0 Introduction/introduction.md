#What this Class Will be About

- This class will try to build a synthesis from the "area studies" of Germany, and (randomly?) selected (!) theories of the social sciences.
    - From an "area studies" perspective, we'll think about:
    - What are the peculiarities (Sonderwege) of German history?
    - What are the meanders (Irrwege) of German history?
    - Germany is interesting because:
        - it's the biggest economy in Europe (3rd in the world)
        - it's a pioneering EU power
        - Jacobs University is in Germany :)
    - We'll make a trip to Berlin
- We'll cover select theories from the social sciences, including:
    - Social Psychology
    - Sociology
    - Game Theory
    - Political Science
    - Evolutionary Theory
    - ... in all of which we'll try to focus on theories of social change (how did A become B, think Marx's historical materialism)
    - ... this is a selection, it's not comprehensive.

#Disclaimers
- This will be a eurocentric (bad term), ethnocentric (bad term), (post-)modern-centric (good term) enterprise.
    - my excuse: I heart modernity.
    - better excuse: both science and the state are essentially modern ideas
    - also, Germany is modern
    - so the theory and thinking about it must be modern, too
    - (this is kind of a big issue)
- this is a (biased) selection of texts, concepts and theories.
    - This class has no "canon" of stuff (Microeconomics does have a canon). Different teachers would hold different versions of this class.
    - Selections of texts, concepts theories in the social sciences are always biased, because they easily imply (normative? axiomatical?) views on human nature, the social world and progress.
    - The best I can do is make my biases transparent, and enable you to question these premises and the literature.

#Background and Theory
- There are background readings, and theory readings.
    - (70%) Background readings: What the hell happened?. (Read this sort of leisurely)
    - (30%) Theory readings: Abstractions and theories of social sciences (Read this very carefully)
    - The Newton & van Deth textbook is somewhere in between.
